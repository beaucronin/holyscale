# Holy Scale

Holy Scale is a cloud experiment to explore the limits of "infintely" scalable serverless apps. The goal of the project is to develop and operate a web service that is guaranteed to always cover its own operating costs - i.e., to have favorable unit economics and (close to) zero fixed costs.

Holy Scale is not just open source, but fully transparent in its operational metrics. Its primary goal is to serve as a conceptual and technology demonstration.
